* Built with NodeJS and ExpressJS, this simple app allows you to write and store unique notes quickly and easily. I worked on this to easily jot down ideas and notes for later, and to serve as a base for future improvements and features to make our lives easier.

* This README file was generated with [auto-readme](https://github.com/taqft/auto-readme/)! Go check it out if you're interested in learning more!
